1. When you decrease kmer length, the contig distribution decreases

2. For longer reads, it is generally expected that one increase their coverage cutoff, *because*
cutoff is used to trim sequence that is not necessary for the alignment in the de Bruijn graph.
If you cutoff too much you may rid your assembly of sequence data that is actually useful to 
completing a more accurate assembly; too small and you may not properly rid your assembly of 
unnecessary artifacts. Cutoff that is set to "auto" in velvet is set to half the expected coverage. 

3. Increasing minimum contig length will decrease the size of the distribution of contigs. 
Conversely, the N50 will increase as minimum contig length increase as minimum contig length decreases.
